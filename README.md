# GitID - Manage Multiple Git Identities Easily

GitID is a convenient command-line interface (CLI) that allows you seamlessly manage and switch between multiple git SSH identities on a single user account.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the different commands of this CLI:

- **Create new identity:**

  This will create a new `ed25519` SSH identity.

  ```
  npx gitid new <identity>
  ```

  Replace `<identity>` with the desired name for your new identity.

- **List identities:**

  This will list all available identities.

  ```
  npx gitid list
  ```

- **Check current identity:**

  This will output the current identity.

  ```
  npx gitid current
  ```

- **Use identity:**

  This will change the Git identity for the repository in the current directory to a specified identity.

  ```
  npx gitid use <identity>
  ```

  Replace `<identity>` with the name of the identity you want to use.

## Do I need GitID?

GitID is your solution if you are:

- Having a hard time managing multiple Git identity files on a single user account
- Struggling with permission issues when accidentally pushing from a wrong identity file
- Tired of having to modify git URLs every time you clone or add a new remote

Sure, a good README generally contains the following sections:
